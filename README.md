jive js - the less is more ui library
===

# Getting Started
 
The first thing you'll need to do is download the source code. Once you have this, include the Javascript and CSS dependencies in the head of your web document.

<!-- Jive CSS-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path_to_css/jive.css" type="text/css" />

<!-- Jive JS-->
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path_to_js/jquery.1.7.1.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path_to_js/jive.min.js"></script>

## Hello World

Now that you have the dependencies included, you'll can now access jive from anywhere in your code, just by using the $j variable. Below is a very basic example:

<script type="text/javascript">
    // say hello!
    $j.hello_world()
</script>
